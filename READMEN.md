Project 1: Multipage HTML
You will design a multipage HTML site for yourself.
The site should feature at least 2 links that allow you to go from a home page to 2 separate pages and back. You should connect each page to CSS styles and ensure each sub page has at least 10 html elements on them. You can choose the elements you want based on what you make the site about.
Some themes to choose from:
Dev Blog (with links to different pages talking about specific coding topics you want to cover)
Song Reviews (with links to different pages talking about songs with a youtube video to the song embedded)
Favorite Movies ( (with links to different pages talking about movies with a youtube video to the movie embedded)
Personal Portfolio (with links to different pages talking about projects or things you're working on)
or whatever you want!
